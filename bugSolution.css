To address the `margin: auto` issue, use a more modern and browser-compatible approach for horizontal centering.  Here are a few alternatives:

1. **Using flexbox:**

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 10px 0;
}
```

2. **Using grid layout:**

```css
div {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  margin: 10px 0;
}
```

3. **Using text-align for inline elements (only if your div is inline):**

```css
div {
  text-align: center;
}
```

For the `box-sizing` issues, ensure that you're using `box-sizing: border-box;` correctly and understand its implications for element sizing (width and height will include padding and border). Always explicitly set widths and heights where possible to avoid layout problems. Thoroughly test your CSS across different browsers and versions.
