# Uncommon CSS Bugs

This repository demonstrates two uncommon CSS bugs:

1. **Unexpected behavior of `margin: auto` in older browsers:**  The `margin: 10px auto;` rule might not center the element as expected in older browsers due to inconsistent interpretation of `auto` for both horizontal margins.
2. **Unexpected behavior with `box-sizing: border-box;`:** Incorrect usage or understanding of `box-sizing` can lead to unexpected sizes and positions of elements, particularly with nested elements and complex layouts. 

The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code and `bugSolution.css` provides the solutions.
